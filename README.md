# Who am I?

Hey i'm Michael, I exploit and also create exploits, I do python, RLua and I am learning C++.
I make DDos, rats, worms and discord loggers(On loop so even re-opening won't stop the logger). Despite that I make safe to use exploits, I have no intent on ruining a owner of my exploits experinces. 

What else should I put here?
